#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: A guessing game about actors and movies, playable both as a single- or multiplayer.

## General initial approach

Given that I have decided to build the app by myself, I have seeked the help of an AI to build, improve and fix the app in the process. The only AI used was ChatGPT, of which I took advantage to explore the new Canvas functionality that had just been implemented when I started my project.
Occasionally I have asked also the duck debugger directly inside VS Code.

The initial plan was much bigger and complex than what it turned out to be - I will talk about this in the section about [Potential improvements](#potential-improvements-and-additional-funcionalities)

The starting point is the whole Finance project from CS50 course. I didn't need any of the code relative to logging in, but I used most of the structure of the Flask app and Templates and I have built upon it.
