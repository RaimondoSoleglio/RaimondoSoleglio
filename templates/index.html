<h1>Welcome to <strong>Guess The Movie</strong>!!!</h1>

<h4>This is my final project for the magnificent course CS50. It's a very simple game, I hope you like it.</h4>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>RULES</strong></h2>
<p>The rules are quite simple.<br/>
Pick the number of players up to 4 and a timer difficulty for the answers, from 15 seconds to 60 (if you want to take it easy).</p>

<p>Each player gets 3 lives.</p>
<p>If you play in single-player mode, at the end the game will tell you
    <br/>
    how many answers you got right within the chosen time.</p>

<p>In multiplayer mode, within one round, each player<br/>
    gets to answer only once and then passes the keyboard to the next player.<br/>
If a player loses all their lives, they are out of the game.<br/>
At the end of the round, if there is only one player left with lives, they are the winner!<br/>
But if at the end of the round there aren't any players with lives left, then we have no winners.</p>
